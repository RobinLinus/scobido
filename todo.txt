## Crawler
- Title Rank: https://www.instagram.com/p/BMSljeEgjhx/
- Title Rank: http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/11/quick-how-might-the-alien-spacecraft-work/
- Image Rank: https://www.amazon.de/Lego-Technic-8053-Mobiler-Kran/dp/B003A2JC0Y/ref=sr_1_11?s=toys&ie=UTF8&qid=1479147331&sr=1-11&keywords=lego+kran
   (Allow data URLs in Crawler)

   
## Security 
- Test Timeouts with URLs that point to very large html files. (i.e. huge Github commit)


## Spam Filter 
- Limit posts per ip
- disallow likes/post/clicks from wrong referrer
- disallow http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/


## General 
- Submit button is not displayed prominently enough
- rank posts/likes with old cookies higher


# Papercuts
- /submit re-focus input on tab change
- use ids instead of urls for links
- IN FF and IE, Scrollbar adds 16px margin to content 
- auto focus recaptcha
- Voting Animation prefixing
- Title Encoding: http://xn--wgv71a119e.jp/support/app_eval/evaluation-mail.html
- Weight upvotes from Tor nodes lower 
- Summit layout on iPhone
- Scroll lags on iPhone (zIndex ?)



# Done
- Replace pink in post-upload animation
- favicon/metatags in submit
- Hide all files in private folder
- Disallow posts from Tor
- Scrolling doesn't work in Firefox
- refresh by pulling down
- /summit surpress submit without recaptcha
- Notify User about success of posting -> redirect imediatly to new page 
- Delete old database entries
- condensing header
- Allow unlike?


# future
- signup hack: display cookie in a password input and let user use the browser's "save the password" function
